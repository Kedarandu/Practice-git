A practice git repository
where you can eff up
as much as you'd like
plus work with a real,
living, breathing person
on the other side. Here
we learn all things git.
Feel free to send Pull Requests
to see what it's like when
someone asks you "Can you squash
your commits for us" and you're
all like "How the hell do I do that?"
