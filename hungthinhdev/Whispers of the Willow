Beneath the moon’s soft glow, the willow weeps, Its branches trailing in the midnight breeze. A sentinel of secrets, it guards the stream, Where dreams and memories intertwine and gleam.

Each leaf a tear, each rustling sigh, Echoes of forgotten love and long-lost ties. The silver strands sway, a dance of sorrow, As if the tree itself yearns for tomorrow.

In whispered verses, it tells its tale, Of ancient love and storms that prevail. The moon listens, a silent confidante, As the willow weaves its melancholy chant.

And so it stands, rooted in the earth, A witness to life’s fleeting mirth. Its name forever etched in the night, “Whispers of the Willow,” a fragile light.

Feel free to give it your own title or let it remain as is. 🌿🌙✨
